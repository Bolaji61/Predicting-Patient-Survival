# Predicting Patient Survival

A hospital has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.

### Project goal
To develop a machine learning model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment.


### This project was submitted as a final assignment solution to a 5-weeks DPhi Bootcamp (India), held remotely. 
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applied several feature engineering techniques and finetuned the XGBoost model used.

Result is, **I ranked 1st position** on the leaderboard containing the submissions of several other participants.
